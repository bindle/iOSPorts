iOS Ports
=========

   iOS Ports is a Collection of F/OSS libraries which have been ported to
   the iPhoneOS/iOS platform.  The conditions of the license of each package
   included in iOS Ports are believed to allow for use of each package on
   an iOS device, however a developer should review the license of each
   package before including it within an application and to verify that the
   application meets the requirements of the conditions.

Quick Start for Xcode 4
-----------------------

   This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the following guides
   available on Apple's Dev Center:

      - Xcode 4 User Guide: Introduction
      - Xcode 4 User Guide: Orientation to Xcode

   For the sake of clarity, this tutorial uses the following information. Be
   sure to substitute information appropiate for your project and setup:

      Project Name:           Zebra
      App Name:               Zebra.app
      Project File:           Zebra.xcodeproj
      Project Location:       /Users/zookeeper/Documents/Zebra/
      iOS Ports Location:     /Users/zookeeper/Documents/iOSPorts/
      iOS Ports Includes:     /Users/zookeeper/Documents/iOSPorts/include
      Relative Include Path:  ../iOSPorts/include

   In order to use packages from iOS Ports the following items need
   to be completed:

      - Download iOS Projects (see "Source Code" section of this README).
      - Note the package information for the packages to be used (see "Packages"
        section of this README).
      - Add iOS Ports Xcode project files to Zebra.xcodeproj.
      - Update the "Build Phases" in Zebra.xcodeproj
      - Update the "Build Settings" in Zebra.xcodeproj.

   Add iOS Ports Xcode project files
   ---------------------------------

      1. Open Zebra.xcodeproj in Xcode.
      2. On the menubar, select "File" -> "Add Files to 'Zebra'..."
         A new dialog should appear.
      4. In the dialog, locate the first Xcode project from the "Add" field
         of the desired iOS Ports package. For example, if adding OpenLDAP to
         your project, you would locate "openldap.xcodeproj".
      5. Click the "Add" button. The xcode project "openldap.xcodeproj" should
         appear in the "Project Navigator".
      6. Repeat for the remaining Xcode projects listed in the "Add" field
         of the desired iOS Ports package.

   Update Build Phases
   -------------------

      Open the Project Editor
      1. Display the "Project Navigator" in the "Navigator Area" of Xcode's
         main window (see "Xcode 4 User Guide").
      2. Click on the project icon in the project navigator (the project name
         is visible next to the project icon).  The project's build settings
         should appear in the "Edit Area" of Xcode's window.
      3. In "TARGETS" section, select the target which will use the iOS Ports
         packages.

      Update "Target Dependencies"
      1. Select the "Build Phases" tab from the project editor.
      2. Expand the "Target Dependencies" section.
      3. Click the "+" button under "Target Dependencies". A list of targets
         should appear.
      4. Locate the first target from the "Dependencies" field of the desired
         iOS Ports package. The target should have an icon of a stone building.
         Using OpenLDAP as an example, you would select "ldap".
      5. Click the "Add" button.
      6. Repeat for the remaining targets listed in the "Dependencies" field
         of the desired iOS Ports package.

      Update "Link Binary With Libraries"
      1. Select the "Build Phases" tab from the project editor.
      2. Expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" section.
      3. Click the "+" button under "Link Binary With Libraries". A list of
         libraries should appear.
      4. Locate the first library from the "Link With" field of the desired
         iOS Ports package. The target should have an icon of a stone building.
         Using OpenLDAP as an example, you would select "libldap.a".
      5. Click the "Add" button.
      6. Repeat for the remaining libraries listed in the "Link With" field of
         the desired iOS Ports package.

   Update Build Settings
   ---------------------

      Update Search Paths
      1. Select the "Build Settings" tab from the project editor.
      2. Search for the setting titled "Always Search User Paths". Change the
         value to "Yes". If the editor is displaying setting names instead of
         setting titles, search for "ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS". If the editor
         if displaying setting definitions instead of setting values, change
         the definition to "YES".
      2. Search for the setting titled "User Header Search Paths". Add the
         relative include path to the iOS Ports include directory. In this
         example, the relative include path is "../iOSPorts/include" since
         both Zebra and iOS Ports are in the same parent directory. If the
         editor is displaying setting names instead of setting titles, search
         for "USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS".

   The project Zebra should now be ready to compile the required static
   libraries and link to them.  The source for the iOS Ports packages will
   be downloaded the first time the packages are compiled.

   When using two or more iOS Ports packages, it is not necessary to follow
   these instructions for packages which are already included by other
   packages.  For example, including OpenLDAP automatically includes OpenSSL
   and Cyrus SASL.
