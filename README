iOS Ports
=========

   iOS Ports is a Collection of F/OSS libraries which have been ported to
   the iPhoneOS/iOS platform.  The conditions of the license of each package
   included in iOS Ports are believed to allow for use of each package on
   an iOS device, however a developer should review the license of each
   package before including it within an application and to verify that the
   application meets the requirements of the conditions.

Packages
========

   Cyrus SASL (security/cyrus-sasl) - A port of Cyrus SASL to the iPhone
      platform (iOS). An open source implementations of Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer methods.
      Depends Upon: security/openssl

   iOSPorts (iOSPorts) - A standalone package for adding iOS Port packages'
      copyright information to an iOS package.  Using this library to display
      the copyright information should fulfill a packages distribution
      requirement according to the Modified BSD license and similar licenses.
      Including this project in an iOS application will not make other iOS
      Ports packages available within an application.

   OpenLDAP (database/openldap) - A port of OpenLDAP client library
      to the iPhone platform (iOS).
      Depends Upon: security/cyrus-sasl

   OpenSSL (security/openssl) - A port of OpenSSL's SSL/TLS and Crypto
      toolkit to the iPhone platform (iOS).
      Depends Upon: n/a

   PCRE (devel/pcre) - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
      Depends Upon: n/a


Quick Start
===========

   Disclaimer:
      I wrote this in five minutes. More documentation will be following over
      the next month or two.  If you would like to assist with documentation
      and tutorials, please contact David M. Syzdek <syzdek@bindlebinaries.com>.

   Assumptions:
      - You understand basic use and navigation of the Xcode interface.
      - You understand basic concepts behind static libraries and header files.
      - You are using the software listed in the "Required Software" section.
      - iOSPorts has been downloaded to /Users/syzdek/development/com.bindlebinaries/iOSPorts
           (Change the above path to the location you downloaded iOSPorts)

   1) Open your project in Xcode.

   2) Open the project settings. From the menubar:

         Project -> Edit Project Settings

   3) Open the "Build" tab. Search for "Header Search Paths", Add the following:

         /Users/syzdek/development/com.bindlebinaries/iOSPorts/include

      This step instructs Xcode where to look for include headers when using
      libraries from iOSPorts.

   4) Add the required iOSPorts Xcode project files to your project by using
      the wizard found on the menubar:

         Project -> Add To Project...

   5) Open the target settings for your application (double click on the
      target).

   6) Open the "General" tab. Add iOSPorts dependencies by clicking the '+'
      button below the "Direct Dependencies" panel and then selecting the
      libraries from the drop down window.

   7) Link the libraries to your target. From the "Groups & Files" panel in
      Xcode's main window, drag the libraries from the iOSPorts Xcode projects
      to the "Link Binary with Libraries" group within your target.

   Your application should now be linked against the iOSPorts libraries you
   setup.

   Please note that since the iOS SDK does not allow creating shared libraries
   for the iOS platform, you must also link all required dependent libraries.
   For instance, to use libldap.a and liblber.a from OpenLDAP, you must also
   link libsasl2.a from Cyrus SASL, libssl.a from OpenSSL, and libcrypto.a from
   OpenSSL.  The dependencies are listed in the packages list above.

   An example application using iOS Ports is available from:
